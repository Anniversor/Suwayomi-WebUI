# Suwayomi-WebUI
This is the repository of the default client of [Suwayomi-Server](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-Server).

The server has this web app bundled by default and is able to automatically update to the latest versions.
Thus, there is no need to manually download any builds unless you want to host the app yourself instead of having it hosted by the Suwayomi-Server.

## Preview
An ongoing changelog of all relevant changes since the last stable release can be found [here](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-WebUI/issues/749)

To use the preview version you can select the PREVIEW channel in the settings of your Suwayomi-Server.
The server is then able to download and also keep the version automatically up-to-date.

Keep in mind that the preview version might need a newer version than the stable server.
In case your server is outdated, it will automatically downgrade to the latest compatible WebUI version.

Minified builds of WebUI can be found here [Suwayomi-WebUI-preview](https://github.com/Suwayomi/Suwayomi-WebUI-preview).

Additionally, there is an online build of the WebUI preview version that is available [here](https://suwayomi-webui-preview.github.io/).
*Make sure to set your Suwayomi-Server hostname in Settings or you'll get infinite loading.* Also note that its the **latest** revision of WebUI and might not work correctly if you connect to a stable build of Suwayomi-Server.
